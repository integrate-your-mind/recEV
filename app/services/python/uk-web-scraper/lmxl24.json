Heros Corner is home alpacas, pygmy goats, Kune Kune pigs and Silke chickens where residents take responsibility for their daily care. Wild birds, including moor hens and mallards with their young can be observed in the reed-bed. Our barn owls interact with the residents. 450 free-range hens scratch about. The eggs they produce are sold on the egg-round, or on site. The Weavery produces high quality and imaginative craftwork, which can be bought or commissioned, pottery takes place weekly. The annual Summer Fayre attracts the public who also enjoy cream teas, ice creams, tombola, archery, bric-a-brac, cakes and bookstalls. Many people with learning disabilities from the local community come on a daily or weekly basis to spend meaningful time with us in the safe and stimulating environment. Weve been here for over 30 years and want to invest in the next 30 years, providing a home and place of work for people with learning disabilities. Our established philosophy of holistic care for people and the environment will be enhanced by our new solar array, which will add to our newly installed bio mass heating and hot water system and the long established reed bed filtration system which takes care of our sanitary needs.

React in Operation Today The charity has seven permanent members of staff working from a single office responding to nearly 2,000 requests a year. The charitys growth has occurred largely from word of mouth and building relationships with medical and social care professionals throughout the UK. By maintaining the original principals of a simple application process for families and a fast, efficient assessment procedure, React can offer a minimal response time (typically 48hours). Unlike many organisations, React places no limits on the number of times in which a family can apply to React for the vital aid they require and React will consider each application it receives, awarding as many as funding will allow. React considers any item that is a basic, essential need. Below is a non-exhaustive list of examples of equipment and assistance that React provides: Type of Equipment Examples Specialist Medical E-Flow Rapid Nebulisers, Sleep Systems, Electric Beds, Pulse Oximeters, P-Pod seats, Portable Suction Machines, Specialist Vests for Gastrostomy Fed Child Mobility Items Powered Wheelchairs, Adapted Tricycles, Ceiling Hoists, Specialist Car Seats, Swivel Bases for Car Seat, Standers, Arm Supports Educational and Developmental Aids Adapted Computers, Portable Touch Screen Tablet PCs, Communication Aids, Voice Recognition Software, Eye-Gaze Machines. React also considers requests for basic essential homecare items and end of life costs. React families are given the opportunity to take one weeks respite a year at one of eight mobile homes across seven different UK locations.

one of the stunning stately homes of Lancashire, a haven for history lovers, where the past meets the present - a fantastic, family day out. Enjoy intrigue, witchcraft and centuries of fascinating history throughout our archive rooms. Have a coffee, a freshly baked scone or a delicious lunch in our highest quality award winning Restaurant. View the Galleries and enjoy or purchase an original work of art. Browse through the antique rooms, find that hidden gem. Visit the shop, take home a Samlesbury memento, our home produced honey or that 'delightful gift'. Tour the grounds, feed the rescued hens, throw a penny into the fountain and make a wish, while away a sunny afternoon. Samlesbury Hall is also home to a busy events and functions programme, where you can tour the Hall with our fabulous Tour Guides, enjoy a theatre production or murder mystery, experience an evening ghost hunt, or welcome your own guests at a wedding that is, entirely yours. Samlesbury Hall is open to visitors all year round, Sunday - Friday, 11am - 4pm (Please check before traveling as we do close occasionally on a Friday for weddings) The Building A fabulous half-timbered black and white medieval house built in 1325 as a family home, the Hall is beautifully maintained for the enjoyment of today's visitor. The current building and grounds are administered by a registered charity known as the Samlesbury Hall Trust (Charity number 526052), whose aim is to preserve the Hall for the people of the area and visitors to Lancashire. The Trust was founded in the 1920s when the Hall was about to be demolished. Since then the Hall has been a museum and Gallery, and host to many grand functions. The Hall is open to the public every day, except Saturdays and occasional Fridays, when it is closed for weddings. On this site today, you will discover an ancient, magnificently preserved manor house and gardens, with a colourful history and a wide-ranging programme of year-round events and activities. Grounds Very little of what was around the Hall when it was first built in 1325 remains, if anything at all, we still get a 'moat' when it pours. But the lovely woodland you see, probably best shows the ancient Hall in its original light. The drive used to be cobbled 'sets' and they are buried underneath the tarmac in in order to facilitate today's traffic (cars and Ladies' heels) You will today see much more structured grounds, with beautifully manicured lawns, pretty borders and box and beech on guard!

Drive up Hulham Road out of Exmouth and turn left on to the B3180 over the Common. A mile on from Woodbury Castle, you will find a narrow tree-lined lane on your left, appropriately called Sanctuary Lane. Half a mile down here on the left is Stallcombe House. Drive through the gates, and your first impression is of tranquillity. Stallcombe was a 16th century farmhouse, set in 55 acres of farmland. Now expanded, for the last 30 years it has been home and a place of work for adults with learning disabilities. All have their own individually furnished bedroom, most of which are en-suite. All are enabled to live happily, develop their talents, and learn new skills to the maximum of their ability in their own time, without pressure or rigidity. A recent addition is Willows, a 6 bedded home specially built to care for the needs of those with autistic spectrum disorders. A safe haven in a busy world. The 5-acre organic garden, provides mostly for the kitchen, but also sells veggie boxes to local restaurants and private homes. Heros Corner is home alpacas, pygmy goats, Kune Kune pigs and Silke chickens where residents take responsibility for their daily care. Wild birds, including moor hens and mallards with their young can be observed in the reed-bed. Our barn owls interact with the residents. 450 free-range hens scratch about. The eggs they produce are sold on the egg-round, or on site. The Weavery produces high quality and imaginative craftwork, which can be bought or commissioned, pottery takes place weekly. The annual Summer Fayre attracts the public who also enjoy cream teas, ice creams, tombola, archery, bric-a-brac, cakes and bookstalls. Many people with learning disabilities from the local community come on a daily or weekly basis to spend meaningful time with us in the safe and stimulating environment. Weve been here for over 30 years and want to invest in the next 30 years, providing a home and place of work for people with learning disabilities. Our established philosophy of holistic care for people and the environment will be enhanced by our new solar array, which will add to our newly installed bio mass heating and hot water system and the long established reed bed filtration system which takes care of our sanitary needs. Stallcombe House is a stand alone registered charity, with over 80 dedicated and well trained staff providing a unique, safe and engaging community environment.", "addressLine1": "Sanctuary Lane Woodbury Salterton", "state": "Devon", "country": "UK", "postcode": "EX51EX", "telephone": "+441395232373", "fax": "+441395233351", "charityNumber": "283877", "facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/search/str/stallcombe+house/keywords_top", "twitter": ""}{"charityLegalName": "Alliance for Inclusive Education", "imageURL": "", "charityWebsite": "http://www.allfie.org.uk", "smallDescription": "", "longDescription": "", "addressLine1": "336 Brixton Road Brixton", "state": "", "country": "UK", "postcode": "SW97AA", "telephone": "+442077376030", "fax": "", "charityNumber": "1124424", "facebook": "", "twitter": ""}{"charityLegalName": "North Ferriby Village Hall Trust", "imageURL": "", "charityWebsite": "", "smallDescription": "", "longDescription": "", "addressLine1": "7 Greenways North Ferriby", "state": "", "country": "UK", "postcode": "HU143JN", "telephone": "+441482633848", "fax": "", "charityNumber": "223908", "facebook": "", "twitter": ""}{"charityLegalName": "Challenge 4 Change (C4C)", "imageURL": "", "charityWebsite": "http://www.challenge4change.org", "smallDescription": "", "longDescription": "", "addressLine1": "Challenge 4 Change Centre 373 Trafford Park Road", "state": "Greater Manchester", "country": "UK", "postcode": "M171AL", "telephone": "+443001231401", "fax": "+443001231401", "charityNumber": "441126141", "facebook": "", "twitter": ""}{"charityLegalName": "Community of All Hallows, The", "imageURL": "", "charityWebsite": "http://www.all-hallows.org.uk", "smallDescription": "Founded in 1872, part of the Anglican Community of All Hallows, this 30 bedded unit specialises in palliative care, rehabilitation and GP assessment with an active day care department...", "longDescription": "Founded in 1872, part of the Anglican Community of All Hallows, this 30 bedded unit specialises in palliative care, rehabilitation and GP assessment with an active day care department.

Please request a donation document and a addressed envelope for use to return your donation . If you do have any questions please contact us by visiting the museum, asking to speak to the curator (or a trustee although we may not always be on site). You could also visit our website, News page at http://www.saddleworthmuseum.co.uk, contact the curator, Peter Fox, on emailcurator@saddleworth.co.uk, post your questions to the Saddleworth Museum, High Street, Uppermill, Saddleworth, Yorkshire, OL3 6HS or telephone us on 01457 874093 The museum opened in 1962 and this is a personal message from our founder.

Enjoy intrigue, witchcraft and centuries of fascinating history throughout our archive rooms. Have a coffee, a freshly baked scone or a delicious lunch in our highest quality award winning Restaurant. View the Galleries and enjoy or purchase an original work of art. Browse through the antique rooms, find that hidden gem. Visit the shop, take home a Samlesbury memento, our home produced honey or that 'delightful gift'. Tour the grounds, feed the rescued hens, throw a penny into the fountain and make a wish, while away a sunny afternoon. Samlesbury Hall is also home to a busy events and functions programme, where you can tour the Hall with our fabulous Tour Guides, enjoy a theatre production or murder mystery, experience an evening ghost hunt, or welcome your own guests at a wedding that is, entirely yours. Samlesbury Hall is open to visitors all year round, Sunday - Friday, 11am - 4pm (Please check before traveling as we do close occasionally on a Friday for weddings) The Building A fabulous half-timbered black and white medieval house built in 1325 as a family home, the Hall is beautifully maintained for the enjoyment of today's visitor. The current building and grounds are administered by a registered charity known as the Samlesbury Hall Trust (Charity number 526052), whose aim is to preserve the Hall for the people of the area and visitors to Lancashire. The Trust was founded in the 1920s when the Hall was about to be demolished. Since then the Hall has been a museum and Gallery, and host to many grand functions. The Hall is open to the public every day, except Saturdays and occasional Fridays, when it is closed for weddings. On this site today, you will discover an ancient, magnificently preserved manor house and gardens, with a colourful history and a wide-ranging programme of year-round events and activities. Grounds Very little of what was around the Hall when it was first built in 1325 remains, if anything at all, we still get a 'moat' when it pours. But the lovely woodland you see, probably best shows the ancient Hall in its original light. The drive used to be cobbled 'sets' and they are buried underneath the tarmac in in order to facilitate today's traffic (cars and Ladies' heels) You will today see much more structured grounds, with beautifully manicured lawns, pretty borders and box and beech on guard! In recent years working animals have been introduced, which are a delight for the children. Don't just visit the buildings, see the grounds, they can be quite magical!", "addressLine1": "Samlesbury Hall Preston New Road Samlesbury Preston", "state": "", "country": "UK", "postcode": "PR50UP", "telephone": "+441254812010", "fax": "", "charityNumber": "526052", "facebook": "https://www.facebook.com/SamlesburyHall/", "twitter": ""}{"charityLegalName": "The Musbury Village Hall", "imageURL": "", "charityWebsite": "", "smallDescription": "", "longDescription": "", "addressLine1": "Musbury Village Hall Seaton Road", "state": "Devon", "country": "UK", "postcode": "EX138AJ", "telephone": "", "fax": "", "charityNumber": "268130", "facebook": "", "twitter": ""}{"charityLegalName": "BEN -
